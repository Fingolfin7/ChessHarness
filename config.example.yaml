  # Maximum move attempts per turn before the player forfeits
  max_retries: 3

  # "text"  — FEN string + ASCII board (works with all models)
  # "image" — rendered PNG board sent to vision-capable models
  #            Falls back to text automatically if rendering fails.

  # Whether to include the list of legal moves in each prompt.
  # true  — models see every legal move; reduces hallucination but uses more tokens.
  # false — models must recall legal moves themselves; harder, tests raw chess ability.
